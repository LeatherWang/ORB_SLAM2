# ORB-YGZ-SLAM
This is YGZ SLAM, a faster version folked from ORB-SLAM2 (see https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2 and the README-ORB-SLAM2.md in this repo). We put the direct tracking in SVO to accelerate the feature matching in ORB-SLAM2. We can get an average 3x speed up and keep almost same accuracy. In addition we also support monocular Visual-Inertial SLAM (VI-SLAM), following idea proposed in Raul's paper.
